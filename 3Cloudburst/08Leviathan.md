8. Leviathan  
  
Okay, are you ready? Let’s have some fun  
Let’s try and talk about Leviathan:  
  
Leviathan, He’s a sea monster  
& he does whatever he wants to  
He is proud of heart, he’s a boaster  
He’s on every horror film poster  
He’s a fire breather, he can roast yah  
Like a slice of bread in a toaster!  
So be careful, don’t get any closer  
‘Cuz he does things he’s not supposed to!  
  
So snuggle up, let me tell you a fairytale  
Let’s begin by imagining a scary whale  
but then enlarge the beast to legendary scale.  
Crystal balls for eyes, let’s make them very pale.  
Fill his mouth full of teeth, sharp rusty nails.  
And his breath smells like Death, slightly musty, stale.  
In fact, I think I smell him, we’re on his tail.  
Count to five, open your eyes, I’m pulling back the veil.  
  
Let’s explore the meaning of this monstrous imagery:  
Free will & grace have a complex synergy.  
But for there to be both justice & liberty  
It’s clear injustice must be a possibility.  
This isn’t rocket science or difficult philosophy  
No need to come to Cambridge to study Theology.  
Alright—let’s continue to explore the mythology  
to help us disentangle God from Evil’s animosity.  
  
Leviathan, he is a dragon  
But where the hell did he come from?  
Some fiery underground dungeon  
where the law is used like a bludgeon  
to hold your soul for a ransom  
in a condemnation-filled chasm.  
Critics hang on the bandwagon  
even when your faults are all phantom.  
  
Okay, let’s do this! Punch the Dragon in the jaw!  
Smash his teeth! And watch him fall to the floor.  
Let’s talk about the telos of the law:  
What on earth did I make rules for?  
What kind of Dad puts the kids with their toys in  
a magic garden with a tree made of poison?  
But drugs are medicines when used with proper caution  
Judgment is a vital tool when you’re the Great Physician.  
  
Don’t be afraid, I’ve got this devil on a dog-leash  
I’m God & I’m fully in control, do you capiche?  
I’m not a church-lunch vicar eating cold quiche--  
My kingdom’s all-encompassing! It should never be niche.  
But that’s what I said, the devil’s under my control  
He might attack your body, but he cannot touch your soul  
This pain it isn’t pointless, there’s a purpose, there’s a goal:  
With heat and pressure I can make a diamond out of coal.  
  
Leviathan, wanna pet him?  
I know he looks quite upsetting  
but he’ll only do what I let him!  
So soothe your soul, & stop sweating  
Don’t fear! No need for trepidation.  
It’s a perfectly good Creation  
Evil’s simply goodness’s privation  
Figment of fear-filled imagination.  
  
Let’s untangle the mess that we call Evil:  
some of it’s choices of sinful people;  
some of it’s judgement; some of it’s danger;  
some of it’s pain, & when pain is a stranger  
to heaven-bound hope, your love-tank gets cratered.  
Then it’s called suffering—we’ll come to that later.  
But don’t fall for the mask—I’m not Darth Vader.  
Though the pain might hide it, I’m a good Creator.  
  
So what conclusions could we learn from this?  
Being sovereign doesn’t mean I’m a determinist.  
I like John Piper. You gotta love his earnestness.  
& that doesn’t mean God’s choice might not determine if  
a sinful soul should be invited to eternal bliss.  
But the grace of God cannot involve coercion. It’s  
not just spite that throws people in the furnace. This  
is key to come to terms with the infernal pit.  
  
Leviathan, he is a dragon  
But where the hell did he come from?  
Some fiery underground dungeon  
where the law is used like a bludgeon  
to hold your soul for a ransom  
in a condemnation-filled chasm.  
Critics hang on the bandwagon  
even when your faults are all phantom.
