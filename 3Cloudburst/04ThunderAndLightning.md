4. Thunder and Lightning  
  
Thunder and lightning, very very frightening…  
  
I heard you call my name. So here I am, I came.  
You wanted to complain that I’ve been inhumane?  
I guess that’s cool, fair game. It comes with the terrain  
of being GOD who reigns in the public domain.  
But I still retain the right to refrain  
from trying to explain all that I’ve ordained.  
Excuse the hurricane. Some people find that rain  
helps with the mental strain of working through the pain.  
  
Thunder and lightning, very very frightening…  
  
I hold the lightning in my hands like Emperor Palpatine  
Fire thunderbolts like spotlights—ultra laser beams.  
Thought the storm would up the drama for these later scenes.  
Sparks fly from my fingers—Van de Graaf machines.  
Let me explain, it’s a scientific gadget  
Used in physics labs to demonstrate electrostatic  
Energy. Just a feature of the space-time fabric  
that I made just to save me overusing magic.  
  
Thunder and lightning, very very frightening…  
  
On that note, I would vote we take a thoughtful pause  
and reflect on the existence of Natural Laws.  
Ever wondered why Everything has a Cause?  
From electrostatic power to gravitational force?  
If a space-time singularity point-source  
were the beginning of things, then that would endorse  
the existence of a Personal Creative Force.  
And by the way, were you there in the beginning? I was.
