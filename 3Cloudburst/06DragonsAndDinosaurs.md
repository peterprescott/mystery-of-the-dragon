  
6.	Dragons & Dinosaurs  
  
Er, I’m sorry God, I admit that you’ve outsmarted--  
Shut up Job, and listen. I’m just getting started.  
  
Man up, mere human! Are you ready for this?  
Hide under your sheets, give your teddy a kiss!  
You’re about to encounter pure heavenly bliss  
A face-to-face tryst with the One who permits  
the devil to dangle you above the abyss  
but I don’t concede that I’ve acted amiss.  
C’mon, let’s have ourselves a battle of wits  
and see finally which one of us submits.  
  
So let’s talk about dragons and dinosaurs  
Let’s ask, Where we come from? What’s it all for?  
Silence the superficial--cut right to the core  
Seek wisdom and you’ll find the key to heaven’s door  
Though you might have to stop exercising your jaw  
Your zeal to have the final word could be your fatal flaw  
Kid, I can show you the world – let me give you the tour  
Step on my magic carpet and sit tight as we take flight and soar!  
  
So man up, mere human – please, don’t be terrified  
Let’s look the real questions straight in the eye  
And ask ourselves What is the meaning of life?  
And is what we thought really true, really right?  
Let’s dare to become like a child and ask Why?  
Why do bad things happen even when we are nice?  
And is the Bible more than merely ethical advice?  
And what’s a sinner supposed to do to enter paradise?  
  
‘Dinosaurs and dragons. That’s just made-up mythology  
and perhaps a splash of prettified paleontogy’  
But listen, these are parables. That’s narrative theology  
Regardless of what you make of layers of geology.  
No, I make no apology for explaining my sovereignty  
by painting you a picture of a mythical monstrosity.  
Mere human, you were made for visual art, not mere philosophy.  
Why d’you think so many sink when tempted by pornography?  
  
An aside: Rudolf Bultmann, demythologise this  
Your attempts to radically theologise missed  
You tried to dance with the Dragon, you acted amiss!  
You fool! Now you’re dead, vanished like the morning mist!  
What were you doing? Were you taking the piss?  
Without miracles how could there ever be eternal bliss?  
And now your soul with Satan sinks into the deep abyss!  
The existential ultimate C-R-I-S-I-S.  
  
I’m sorry, Rudolf — am I calling you names?  
Changed your mind? Wanna come and join the reindeer games?  
Do I look like Santa Claus? Do I ride on a sleigh?  
Cuz Satan’s not just Santa with the N rearranged!  
Now you’re trapped in Satan’s claws, and we can’t build a case  
to possibly make you eligible for my grace.  
The one miracle I can’t do is to somehow erase  
the choices you made. No, it’s really too late.
