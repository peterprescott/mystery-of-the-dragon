2. Gospel Outburst  
  
Lord before I start, I dedicate these words to you.  
You destined me for this even before my mother’s womb.  
Many words can lead to sin so I’ve kept my words few–  
I’ve quietened my soul, been still and silent, even mute.  
But now my heart is burning and my tongue’s on fire too–  
How can I be silent when men who are violent keep talking like they do?  
I’ve waited for the aged to speak, for I am just a youth  
But the Spirit of God lives in me too and it’s him who teaches truth  
  
So Maker, here’s my prayer: Help me not show partiality  
To man or woman, black or white, for you made all humanity  
Please help my words at all times correspond to reality  
Help me not exaggerate or treat the truth elastically  
Or abuse half-truths to rudely use my speech sarcastically  
See Maker what I’m saying, though I put it periphrastically  
is make my words the overflow of Christlike spirituality–  
And let my tongue speak not of me but magnify your majesty!  
  
First things first: the reason I’m speaking rhymes is not because of me.  
This gift of speaking lyrically with some verbal agility  
Is not something I’ve practised — it’s a God-given ability,  
So please don’t just encourage me, give glory to the Trinity!  
It’s the Spirit indwelling me who taught my tongue these words. You see,  
The Maker in eternity spoke the Word which caused the world to be  
And now his Spirit lives in me! That’s why I speak in poetry.  
But let’s pause briefly because we’ve reached the time for me to breathe.  
  
Well, I’ve been sitting quiet here among you for some time.  
Like Shakespeare says, the world’s a stage — if so, I’ve been the mime.  
But now’s the point of crisis and to my surprise I find  
I’m centre-stage, I’ve come of age, the spotlight is now mine.  
And suddenly I’m bursting, I’m a wineskin filled with wine  
And I’m rhyming without trying — this’s my original design  
I’m an urban John the Baptist, standing here and prophesying  
That the Maker is returning so you’d better get in line!  
  
Don’t be intimidated, for you know I’m only just  
A mere human just like you — it’s same for all of us:  
Sooner or later, we meet our Maker, and crumble into dust.  
The one quality that distinguishes me, is the God in whom I trust:  
He’s the Maker and Judge of all the earth: and the law explains to us,  
A judge can’t punish whom he choose, he judges whom he must  
So the logical conclusion is that though my God’s gracious  
If you’ve ever committed wrong, frankly he’s dangerous!  
  
So let me ask you something — Do you think that this is right?  
To say that God is in the wrong and you are in the right?  
This is the Maker of the stars, who clothes himself with light  
Compared with his holiness, the bright noonday resembles night  
Even the angels hide their eyes before the blinding light  
That proceeds from his throne above the heaven’s highest height  
And yet you’d rather claim that God’s to blame now for your plight?  
Don’t you know that there in no-one righteous in his sight?  
  
So listen mate you need to stop your self-righteous grumbling  
I don’t pretend to understand the mystery of suffering  
But acknowledge your sin, God will draw near you if you come to him,  
For that’s the kind of God he is: good, patient, kind, longsuffering!  
Wow, even just to speak of Him makes my heart begin trembling  
And honestly I do not think there’s anything resembling  
The glory of the Lord we’ll see one day with saints assembling  
In countless multitude and there before him join as one and sing!
