5.	Consider Creation  
  
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder  
consider all the works thy hand hath made…  
  
So you want revelation? Consider creation.  
Simple observation. Here’s a demonstration.  
Perfect illustrations for your situation.  
God’s communication. Open invitation.  
  
Consider the lion, top of the food chain  
He stalks the savannah, wearing a huge mane  
Have you ever thought to ask yourself, Who trained  
him to hunt prey. Pray tell, Was it you friend?  
  
Consider the rhino, with his ivory horn.  
That precious proof of power I gave him when he was born.  
Why not set him to work? He’d help harvest your corn!  
Surely you have the brains! Surely you have the brawn!  
  
Consider the hawk, circling on the heights.  
I presume that you’ve mastered the science of flight?  
And survey all the earth with your eagle eyesight?  
I hope that my sarcasm’s not impolite.  
  
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder  
consider all the works thy hand hath made…  
  
Consider the deer, giving birth to her babies.  
Fragile little things, have you checked on them lately?  
I see the whole world, but I know every tree  
I’m keeping an eye on beautiful Bambi.  
  
Consider the ostrich, her head in the sand.  
She was never the smartest bird in her clan,  
yet she’s quick as the quickest racehorse ever ran.  
God’s foolishness!—wiser than wisdom of man.  
  
Consider the freedom of the wild pony  
Unconcerned to compete for some tiny trophy.  
No bridle or bit, she’s able to roam free.  
I keep her company, she’s never lonely.  
  
Consider the warhorse, with his galloping hooves,  
Marvel at the majestic way that he moves.  
Surely here is a creature that perfectly proves  
you should fear the Lord, if you’re searching for truth.  
  
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder  
consider all the works thy hand hath made…
