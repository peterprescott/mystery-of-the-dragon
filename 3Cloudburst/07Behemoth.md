7. Behemoth  
  
Meet Behemoth – how can I give you a graphic  
image for your mind’s eye? He is the classic  
long-tailed herbivore from the Jurassic  
era, you’ll have seen him in cinematic  
glory. Remember that first panoramic  
moment in the movie, the cast stand static,  
overwhelmed with a reverence almost catholic  
as they pause to worship that dinosaur magic.  
  
‘Worship’? too strong?—but did you ever notice  
The skeleton of the diplodocus,  
the Natural History Museum’s central focus,  
deliberately positioned to try and provoke us  
to mistrust the historical accounts of Moses,  
while up the staircase Darwin gloats ov--’r us?  
Alone on his throne,--with a ferocious  
frown for whoever denies his di’gnosis.  
  
It’s not about being a six-day creationist.  
Paul Garner tells me there’s answers in Genesis  
but the answers depend on what the question is.  
And I believe that the major emphasis  
isn’t the age of the earth, but earth’s blessedness,  
before Adam & Eve’s moral carelessness  
opened the door to a world filled with merciless  
beasts with teeth that are sharp and venomous.  
  
The Dragon we’ll come to, let’s talk about Dinosaurs:  
scientists work hard to see what we find in store  
when we observe the earth in ways not heretofore  
considered, constantly seeking the answers for  
how the earth works, and whether furthermore  
one single theory might fully account for  
all of the data, and then they’d close the door  
on the ‘God of the gaps’, whom they so deplore.  
  
Some of it boils down to intellectual idolatry,  
and a failure to accept the limitations of bodily  
existence—this is expressed in so much technology.  
If more people just had a modicum of modesty,  
instead of using ‘science’ as an excuse for snobbery,  
disengaging from the problems that more commonly  
afflict the human race in the day-to-day of ordin’ry  
life, then this discussion would increase in quality.  
  
But it’s not all pride--it’s not all hypocrisy.  
There are real questions about methodology.  
When talking of truth, what is our authority?  
How to agree on hermeneutical policy?  
And can we allow ourselves freedom to disagree?  
And if we do, is the other the enemy?  
And where are we supposed to find the energy  
to work in harmony for the good of humanity?  
  
Now many people seem to have the impression  
that it is forbidden to keep asking questions.  
Where did they hear this satanic suggestion?  
To ask is no sin! Questions need no confession!  
Regardless of whatever has caused the suppression  
of perhaps the most powerful tool of progression  
in wisdom and learning and moral perfection--  
resolve now to ask! And make truth an obsession!  
  
But before you start asking, ask yourself this:  
‘is my desire to be answered, remiss’.  
perhaps it’s rooted in ungratefulness  
rather than faithful curious-ness.  
Keep conscience tender to the Spirit’s kiss.  
Don’t let your heart fall into the abyss  
for down there be dragons, who swallow Pharis—  
--sees with ease, with a smack of their lips.
