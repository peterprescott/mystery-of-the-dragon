9. End of Theodicy  
  
This momentary trial will not be a disaster.  
Don’t worry, it will be happily ever after.  
It’s gonna be alright: trust me, I’m a Father.  
Each tear will bring forth peals of laughter.  
  
Innocent Suff-ring – I could stop it if I wanted to  
But there’d be no salvation then, that’s just a simple gospel truth  
Yes that’s the simple gospel truth, that Jesus came and died for you  
& because He was innocent, His suff-ring paid the price for you  
Or else you’d all be guilty, with nothing you could do  
To ever try to pay the price that justice would require of you  
So whatchyou gonna do? I said whatchyou gonna do?  
Complain about injustice when there’s mercy just for you?  
  
This momentary trial will not be a disaster.  
Don’t worry, it will be happily ever after.  
It’s gonna be alright: trust me, I’m a Father.  
Each tear will bring forth peals of laughter.  
  
I know it’s not all simple though I promise this is true:  
I’ll never make you suffer more than I myself went through  
But some of you have suffered much more than you deserved to  
And to this day you suffer still and don’t know what to do.  
You wonder if I’m truly good, You wonder if I’m cruel  
You wonder if the faith you’ve put in me makes you a fool  
But trust me, you are almost there, the end is coming soon  
& your faith will be revealed to be a perfect, precious jewel.  
  
This momentary trial will not be a disaster.  
Don’t worry, it will be happily ever after.  
It’s gonna be alright: trust me, I’m a Father.  
Each tear will bring forth peals of laughter.  
  
And I know that doesn’t answer the essence of the mystery  
But you must understand that there is nothing so precious to me  
As when a true believer keeps continuing to trust in me  
Even when to do so strips him of his own prosperity  
And doesn’t even, to the natural eye, prefer posterity.  
Yes when the faithful persevere though suffering’s severity  
It proves to all the watching world the truth of faith’s temerity  
Which in spite of the enemy, in Christ will have the victory.  
  
This momentary trial will not be a disaster.  
Don’t worry, it will be happily ever after.  
It’s gonna be alright: trust me, I’m a Father.  
Each tear will bring forth peals of laughter.  
  
So you’ve got to stop thinking ‘This is all about me’  
And understand that suff’ring’s an opportunity  
To encounter the grace of God and see His glory  
and put that glory on display for all the world to see.  
‘Cuz there are people watching you who do not believe  
that there could even be a God, since so many grieve  
and so many suffer, and so many are bereaved  
but somehow just through watching you, they’ll begin to perceive  
  
the reality  
of The Holy Trinity.  
The Living God who became flesh  
and died upon the tree.  
In about 30 AD.  
On the hill of Calvary.

So that’s all folks. We’ve reached the end of the odyssey  
The quest to digest a biblical theodicy.  
We’ve powered through at blistering velocity  
Sometimes the rhymes have been of ruthless ferocity.  
I hope you’ve found something to arouse your curiosity  
Remember this ain’t about religiosity  
Just freely forgive & live life with generosity  
that’s pretty much all there is to it, honestly.
