1.	Dying Sigh  
  
It’s the sigh of a dying man – show me wisdom  
My friends came with philosophy—so I quizzed them  
to see if maybe there might be some rhyme or rhythm  
or reason to explain why I’ve been made a victim  
of more evil than most people think could afflict them.  
I’ve been trapped and attacked—even my life’s a prison  
But your neat-and-tidy self-righteous moralism  
is no help at all! It’s an empty system!  
  
O God! I feel the need for a mediator.  
Someone to fight my cause, like a Gladiator.  
One day I’ll say I’m back, just like Terminator.  
Till then, I need some kind of vindicator  
who can hook my heart to a defibrillator.  
Someone to rescue me from this incinerator.  
A sort of heavenly communicator,  
someone to be my divine arbitrator.  
  
Goddamn! the anger’s rising up inside of me  
I’m trying with all my might to live life righteously  
This rage is colouring my vision, it’s slowly blinding me  
Why is everybody set on always undermining me?  
In all of this misery what could the silver lining be?  
And yet inside, I see the light of someone who’s inviting me  
to enter in to greater depth, I hear a voice reminding me  
I gave the go-ahead for God to begin redesigning me.  
  
But God, I can’t take this. There’s way too much pressure.  
Can’t revival start with style? I could wear more leather.  
Please God, just let me fly away on my zephyr.  
I’m through the Looking Glass, still don’t feel any better  
I’m Alice in Wonderland, He’s smiling like Cheshire  
If God is a DJ, then I’m MC Escher.  
S’like having a lecture with a college professor  
when I’ve forgotten the basics. I need a refresher.
