So please don't / let yourself forget  
I am God / I am not your pet  
I am free/ I’m not in your debt  
And I'm just / just not finished yet  
And now go! go cast out your net  
And dive in to the deep where the water's wet...  
And dive in to the deep where the water's wet...  
And dive in to the deep where the water's wet.  
  
So come follow me & be a fisher of men  
Don’t forget who I am or I’ll remind you again  
I’m God – you’re not – but we can still be friends  
After all, that is humankind’s chief end.
