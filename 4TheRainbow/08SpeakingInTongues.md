08.	Speaking In Tongues  
  
Rainbow lights in technicolour  
You’re my One, there is no other  
Time has stopped. Now let’s discover  
what it means to be a Lover.  
  
I taste the air in my lungs, I feel the heat of the sun  
I feel so free and so young, I think I’m speaking in tongues!  
I can’t believe that I’ve won, The battle’s already done,  
I’ve never had so much fun, I think I’m speaking in tongues!  
  
Pure light, pure fire, pure heavenly burning  
My heart, my soul, consumed with yearning,  
This love, this light, I’m undeserving,  
So pure, so right, my spirit’s stirring.  
  
Here I am, I’m face to face,  
Confronted by irresistible grace  
Hardly dared to believe in such a place  
no need to hold back, ‘just in case’.
