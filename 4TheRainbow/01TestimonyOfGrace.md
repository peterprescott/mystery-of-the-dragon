10. Testimony of Grace  
  
My ears had heard, now my eyes have seen  
the glory of the living God—directly! I’ve been  
knocked off my high horse by an ultralight beam  
Bless Him! Holy Spirit interrupted my routine.  
I was an X-rated X-man, I was Wolverine.  
My heart was a Dragon’s, hard and mean.  
But now I’m putty in your hands, I’m plasticine,  
Rediscovering John Three-Sixteen.  
  
Of course I’d read it before, I thought I got it.  
Kept the verse on a card in my shirt’s front pocket.  
but then I ignored it, and if I’m honest  
focussed more on the contents of my wallet.  
Not that anything’s wrong with pursuing profit.  
Business as Mission—that’s another topic!  
But losing your first love, is catastrophic--  
we all know, lukewarm water makes Jesus vomit!  
  
I’m not sure I even understood, all the details  
of what the Lord said—something about whales?  
But something fell from my eyes—like Dragon scales!  
And for the first time I understand the nails  
that were driven through the hands and feet of Jesus,  
God’s glory made perfect in human weakness,  
to redeem us from the Dragon, and sin’s uncleanness,  
O! that you would know this heavenly sweetness!  
  
I used to avoid anger—thought it best to disengage,  
rather than run the risk of blowing my pressure gauge.  
But a good Father’s not passive, He’s filled with holy rage  
when evil lies trap his children inside of a cage.  
But now I think I’ve had a revelation of God’s grace  
Jesus drank the cup of wrath. Now there’s not a trace  
of judgement in the Father’s heart--my sins are all erased!  
And He died bleeding on the cross for the whole human race!  
  
This is my testimony—I’ve made it to the Promised Land!  
And I came through the wilderness, but now I think I understand  
that everything that’s happened, was part of a more perfect plan  
orchestrated by the Father’s counsel and command.  
And if you’ve listened this far, I believe that it’s for you:  
the revelation that in Christ the Dragon’s been subdued.  
Muslim, Mormon, Hindu—whatever your worldview;  
Atheist, or Buddhist—this goes out to Christians, too!
