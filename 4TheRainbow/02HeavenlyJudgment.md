02. Heavenly Judgment  
  
[Child:] Okay, but I have a question.  
Job’s children? Did they go to heaven?  
[Father:] That’s a great question, son. Let’s ask the Spirit  
to let us have one more heavenly visit.  
  
[God:] Lucifer, old devil! is that you again?  
What brings you back here, my friend?  
Are you still in doubt about the faith of J!  
There’s nothing left for you to take away!  
  
[Satan:] I’ll ignore that comment, if you don’t mind.  
Rubbing salt in the wound just isn’t kind.  
Your honour, I’ve come here for the trial  
of Job’s damned children: vulgar, vile  
examples of sinful spoilt brats,  
unworthy of this heavenly habitat.  
I think they belong in hell with me,  
if you knew what they’d done, then you’d agree.  
Honestly, I’m sure it’s a waste of time  
to examine their records of countless crimes.  
The case for damnation is overbearing,  
but since you insist on a full hearing  
we stand before your judgment seat  
to tally their moral balance sheet.  
Ah, here they are, shall we begin?  
to condemn these prodigals for their sin?  
  
[God:] Satan, [Satan: Lucifer!] my old nemesis,  
your constant condemnation is venomous.  
Let’s not judge without seeing the evidence  
That’s the very definition of prejudice!  
Okay, Gabriel—bring us the books!  
Let’s look through these lives, have ourselves a look!  
  
In immediate response to the Lord’s command,  
an angel approaches with books in his hand.  
  
[Satan:] Thank-you, seraph—or should I say ‘serf’?  
since you’re still a slave on this taskmasker’s turf.  
Yes, your honour, of course I meant you--  
since slavery’s not something you object to.  
Enough of that! Let’s examine the reports  
I guarantee there’ll not be one thing to applaud.  
Well, we should already by now’ve begun  
Shall we start with Job’s first-born son?  
Ah, look at this! What have we here?  
Mm, yes you see. It’s just as I feared.  
Bullying, lying, swearing and cheating,  
picking his nose during a prayer meeting,  
Underage drinking, underage sex,  
illegal drug abuse—what happens next?  
Violence, profanity, and promiscuity—  
No, there’s no room for ambiguity— ,  
a foul and frequent pornographic addiction,  
a selfish and self-centred predisposition  
to abusing others for his own ugly ends:  
did I mention the rape of two girls—and three men?  
And then we come to the brutal murder—  
  
[God:] That’ll do Satan. I think I heard yah.  
I know all of this. I know it’s evil.  
I know the wickedness in the hearts of people.  
It doesn’t shock me, I’m not surprised.  
But I know the struggle and I empathise  
with the battle to stand against temptation.  
I know first-hand the frailty of creation.  
That doesn’t excuse it—I cannot condone  
evil, and people reap the seeds they’ve sown.  
But I knew the risk when I first resolved  
to make a world that would truly involve  
the real choices of women and men  
who would have freedom, time and again,  
to decide for themselves whether they would  
trust in the truth that their Maker is good,  
and therefore take moral knowledge from me  
instead of from things that their eyes can see.  
That, as you know, is the point of the Tree  
of Good and Evil, in Genesis Three.  
It does make me angry, it makes my blood boil,  
to see lust and lawlessness cause such turmoil,  
for I know what will happen. I know where it leads—  
that’s why I prohibited immoral deeds.  
It’s not for my own sake, but those that I made.  
for justice requires that a penalty’s paid.  
But how is a sinner to save their own soul  
when the soul itself is the price of sin’s toll?  
Now I understand there are plenty who  
assume this is a Catch Twenty-Two.  
But we’d assessed the risks of creation,  
and after some careful calculation,  
made a covenant before the foundation  
of the earth, that in this situation  
we’d engineer the Incarnation,  
making God-the-Son a blood-relation  
of humankind--by representation,  
to bear humanity’s condemnation!  
Thus fulfilling the need for mediation,  
so we manage to fulfil the law’s demands,  
and the definition of the word ‘righteous’ expands  
to include all those who trust in Christ  
and through his death on the cross are justified.  
  
[Satan:] Your honour, please, avoid the digressions.  
You must learn the art of verbal compression.  
Since you don’t deny the man's transgression  
then the only remaining question,  
is that of this loophole that you’ve put in place.  
Did the accused ever have any faith?  
As you know, without works, faith is dead,  
and it really doesn’t need to be said,  
this man’s life absolutely didn’t ‘work’!  
As we have shown, he was a selfish jerk.  
But what if he believed just before he died?  
And gets a free ticket to Paradise  
conveniently managing to hide  
whether his faith was just an outside  
show or a real, true expression  
of a holy Christian soul’s confession.  
Let’s see, did he put his faith in Jesus  
just in time, which would guarantee his  
worthless soul’s meritless salvation--  
let’s do the needful examination!  
And when we do, ‘alas’, we see  
that in the moment just before he  
died, he explicitly denied Christ,  
the one way he could have been justified.  
So, your honour, the case is closed,  
and as you’ll see, I have proposed…  
  
[God:] Hold on Satan, not so quickly  
I know that you’re tough and tricky  
But stop right there, give that lad back,  
I want us to consider this flashback…
