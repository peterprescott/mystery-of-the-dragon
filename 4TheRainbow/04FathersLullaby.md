  
04. Fatherâ€™s Lullaby  
  
Before you sleep, my son,// let me pray for you//  
There's a father's benediction// I must say for you//  
As you lie down to rest//May God make you truly bless'd//  
Before you sleep, my son,// let me pray for you//  
  
I pray that you would know// the Father's love for you//  
A flame of fire exploding// in His heart for you//  
I pray that you would know//Somewhere deep within your soul//  
I pray that you would know// the Father's love for you//  
  
I pray that you would know// the Father's plans for you//  
He had a purpose from before// the world began for you//  
I pray that you would know//A sense of destiny that grows//  
I pray that you would know// the Father's plans for you//  
  
I pray that you would know// the Father's power on you//  
For there's nothing that is// impossible for Him to do//  
And as you walk by faith//Enabled by His grace//  
I pray that you would know// the Father's power on you//  
  
I pray that you'd receive// the Father's wealth for you//  
There's more than just pros//perity and health for you//  
Of course I do believe//That He will give you all you need//  
But I pray you'd receive all// the Father's wealth for you//  
  
I pray that you'd accept// the Father's discipline//  
He is not judgemental// but He hates your sin//  
I pray that you would know// Freedom from all that hinders love//  
I pray that you'd accept// the Father's discipline//  
  
I pray that you'd be safe//under the Father's wings//  
For the world is filled with// dangerous and wicked things//  
But there's a secret place// in the Father's strong embrace//  
Where you'll be completely safe// under the Father's wings//  
  
Of all my prayers for you// my son, I'd rather//  
That none of them be answered// but you'd know God as your Father//  
In spite of my brokenness//--Yes, your human father's quite a mess!--//  
I pray that you would know// God as your Father//  
  
As you sleep my son,// this is your lullaby//  
It's more than just a prayer--// this is my heart-cry//  
That you'd come to know God//  As your Saviour and Lord//  
Yes, as you sleep my son,// may you be safe tonight//  
Yes, as you sleep my son,// you are your Father's delight//  
Yes, as you sleep my son,// this is your lullaby//
