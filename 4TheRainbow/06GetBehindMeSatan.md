06. Get Behind Me, Satan!  
  
Okay Lucifer, you’ve seen the evidence  
of his faith. So all else is irrelevant.  
This one is mine. He gave his life to me,  
so I recommend that you leave him be.  
  
Surely not, God. A toddler’s prayer?  
That is ridiculous. This is unfair!  
How can that childish moment count?  
Why, I’d say it’s tantamount  
to cosmic child abuse to let  
the words of one who is not yet  
even five years old translate  
into an everlasting fate.  
  
[thunder] FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON,  
THAT WHOSOEVER/ WHOSOEVER/ WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM, SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE. (John 3:16)  
  
Ah hem, that objection is just my first.  
The next returns to the need for ‘works’.  
We’ve already looked at his record of sin,  
it says in First Corinthians Six Verse Ten  
that no-one with the sort of record he’s got  
can possibly inherit the kingdom of God.  
  
FOR BY GRACE ARE YE SAVED THROUGH FAITH;  
AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES: IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD:  
NOT OF WORKS, LEST ANY MAN SHOULD BOAST. (Ephesians 2:9)  
  
Oh my God, would you please stop making  
that horrible noise—my ears are aching.  
I think we need to take at least one more look  
at his catalogue of evils. Let’s re-open the book--  
[pages rustling] wait, I don’t understand what’s going on!  
the pages are blank! His sins are all gone!  
  
[thunder] HE CANCELLED/ CANCELLED/ CANCELLED THE RECORD OF THE CHARGES AGAINST US  
AND TOOK IT AWAY BY NAILING IT TO THE CROSS” (Colossians 2:14).  
  
Haven’t you read that all you need  
is faith as small as a mustard seed?  
Is it necessary that I underscore,  
where sin abounds, grace abounds the more?  
Get behind me, Satan. Get out of my presence  
I’m casting you out of the heavens.  
In fact, I suggest you leave yourself before I begin  
expressing my fury that you caused one of my little ones to sin.  
  
Now, son, come here—they call you Solomon, don’t they?  
You made it! Well done—now we’ll dance the night away.  
But before the party starts, I have to say this directly—  
Solomon, you wasted your life. Abjectly.  
I had so many good works prepared specifically for you,  
I had such great and glorious things planned that you could do.  
There was a unique, individual calling and destiny  
which involved so much more than just this clemency.  
But alas, you missed it! You completely failed to enter in  
to the fullness! – Oh well, at least now you can begin!
