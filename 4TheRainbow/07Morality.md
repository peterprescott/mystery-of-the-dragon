07.	Morality  
  
[Solomon:] I’m not sure I’m ready for this. Do I even want to be saved?  
Is it even fair to be forgiven just for a prayer I prayed?  
I’m relieved to be safe from the Dragon—that much I hardly need to say!  
But is heaven really the place for me?—after all, you must know, I’m gay.  
  
[God:] My beloved son, I know your past, I know all you have done.  
But fundamentally who you are is still my spiritual son.  
I know sometimes you’ve not fit in. And it’s awkward to feel odd.  
But when you received Jesus as Lord, you became a child of God.  
Now it’s fair to say you may have lived without much discipline  
indulging sensual appetites with fifty shades of sin  
but my love for you’s fully without conditionality,  
regardless of your record of personal morality.  
  
[Solomon:] Morality’s all relative! Surely that cannot be denied?  
I lived my life according to the truth of what I felt inside!  
I know I never had a set of rules that had been codified  
but I treated others like I would have liked –at least I tried!  
  
[God:] Morality’s all relative. The only absolute is Me.  
But does that leave us in a fog of moral relativity?  
Only if we settle for ethical passivity  
and let our contexts cage us in cultural captivity.  
But at its best this urges us to act with sensitivity,  
always giving space for our human subjectivity  
without defaulting to a flat unfeeling ‘objectivity’  
which short-circuits the flow of interpers’nal creativity.  
  
What implications might this have regarding sexuality?  
and questions of diversity and marital legality?  
Questions that are hard to handle with impartiality  
since they cut directly to the heart of personality,  
especially in our modern age of individuality  
where hi-tech tools allow us to ignore object reality  
and lose ourselves in virtual worlds of sweet sentimentality.  
Is it possible to find a point of commonality?  
  
Perhaps that point is found in our desire to live authentically,  
which at its root is all about our purpose and identity.  
‘Baby I was born this way’, the radio sings endlessly,  
but what’s the purpose for which you were born? What is your destiny?  
And that’s a question that moves modern man with great intensity:  
as medicine allows us lives of lengthening longevity  
whence can we learn the skills to live with spiritual integrity?  
And is a human person just biology and chemistry?  
  
‘Morality’s all relative’, we’ve said. But so is space and time.  
Nevertheless, the truth is that all human beings have been designed.  
And differences in gender were part of my plan for humankind.  
No sooner will we say this, than someone will speak up to remind  
us that there are those who do not neatly fit within the lines  
of ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories. Well, brokenness can’t be denied.  
Recall though, in John chapter nine, the question, ‘Why was he born blind?’  
The answer? ‘So that in his life, God’s power would be magnified’.  
  
But to describe as ‘broken’ all who struggle with sexuality,  
--or in fact don’t struggle, but, embrace being LGBT—  
is unacceptable or at least incorrect politically.  
Though that we need not hide our shit is true and I indeed agree.  
And denying who we are is neither holy nor healthy.  
But don’t base self-definition on mere sexual activity,  
for action should be fruit not cause of personal identity,  
and let’s discern between the act, and the mere propensity.  
  
You do what you don’t want to do, and what you want to, you don’t do.  
And what you want to want to do, may not be what you should want to.  
And if you knew what you should do, the likelihood is still that you  
would want to do things that now you know that you should not want to do.  
So to conclude, though you’re confused, your conscience needs to be renewed,  
and the rebel urge to resist all restraint must be subdued.  
But whether you’re in solitude, or mingling with the multitude,  
the answer to this problem’s not to work on moral fortitude--  
  
Counter to your expectation, in fact the only foundation  
for guaranteed transformation is to come into relation—  
--ship with Me, your G-O-D! That will change the whole equation.  
When you find true peace of mind and see that there’s no condemnation  
for whatever ‘wrongs’ you’ve done, and that your ‘rights’ can’t earn salvation,  
then, for the first time, you can experience true liberation  
from the fear that drives you to attempt your self-justification.  
Grace releases you to find at last your personal vocation.  
  
Please don’t think I’m asking for a peaceful, passive abdication  
of your mind and will, accepting life with stoic resignation  
and never complaining. No! I want your conversation!  
Let’s fight this out! Wrestle all night! Have real communication.  
I’m not totalitarian, I never liked dictation.  
And when I spoke the Word at the beginning of creation,  
I gave the Spirit total freedom of interpretation.  
Relationships require wild and free imagination.  
  
[Solomon:] ‘Wild and free?’ Then why not be pro-homosexuality?  
Why this marriage monopoly? Why’s heterosex-ed monogamy  
the only place one should engage in sex? What’s wrong with sodomy  
between consenting adults? Is love such a monstrosity?  
  
[God:] Ignoring the anatomy, it’s all about idolatry.  
Idolising sex and self. Denying My authority.  
For sex is a prophetic sign, whether it’s done wrong or right.  
But the party’s getting started. Please, would you accept the invite?  
Simply confess the fact that you have not lived as you wanted to,  
and trust in the truth that Jesus died upon the cross for you,  
and accepting forgiveness  ask for the Spirit to come into  
your heart and He will show to you what’s beautiful, and pure, and true.  
  
Come to the table! Come and be fed!  
My body’s been broken, my blood has been shed!  
I’ve died for your sins! I’ve been raised from the dead!  
And now there’s a banquet, the table’s been spread!  
Breathe in the aroma of freshly-baked bread!  
And treat yourself to a taste of the red  
wine, let it knock you heels over head!  
Come have communion with the Godhead!
