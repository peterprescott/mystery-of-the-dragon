03. Flashback  
  
The scene shifts to forty years before.  
There’s a man with a baby, he’s about twenty-four.  
He’s familiar—we’ve seen him before…  
Of course, it’s Job! But much younger, and poor.  
  
This was before he had made his billions,  
before his wife had nine other children.  
This was before his humble head had risen  
from rags to riches, in rich fulfilment  
  
of all of his bold faith-filled declarations  
made every morning, in great expectation,  
that God would give power and revelation  
to bring the Kingdom of God to the nations.  
  
From what Job has himself confessed,  
It seems to me that we might suggest  
that Job’s father-heart was put to the test  
by all the blessings with which he was blessed.  
  
Specifically, we might say that his family  
regrettably dropped to a lower priority  
than multiplying his financial prosperity  
so as to empower his Kingdom philanthropy.  
  
For righteous Job to idolise his job! How ironic!  
And if the accusation of ‘idolatry’s too strong, it  
is still worth identifying, at an embryonic  
stage the sins that plague us, before they become chronic.  
  
I don’t want to moralise, please understand!  
And in a mysterious sense, someone can  
fulfil the purpose, and fulfil the plans  
God has for them in their generation  
  
and yet, fail their wife, and fail their kids.  
That’s what King David of Israel did!  
Forgive me, I’m straying from the grid--  
Let’s watch: Job is putting his first-born to bed.
