05. Daddy, I'm Afraid  
  
[Child:] Daddy, I’m afraid of the Dragon…  
  
[Father:] ‘Afraid of the dragon’. Son, what do you mean?  
I thought you were sleeping. Did you have a bad dream?  
Don’t be afraid, son. Daddy’s right here.  
Go back to sleep—there’s no need to fear.  
  
[Child:]  But Daddy, what if the Dragon tries to kill me?  
  
[Father:] Listen to me, son. If the Dragon ever tries  
anything funny with you, open your mouth and cry  
out to your Daddy. And, wherever you are  
Daddy will rescue you, I promise! Cross my heart.  
  
[Child:] But Daddy—if I do die, will I go to heaven?  
  
[Father:] My son! The Bible guarantees us  
that because of the blood of Jesus  
every Christian will go to heaven  
to spend eternity in God’s presence.  
  
[Child:] But Daddy, how do I become a Christian?  
  
[Father:] In one sense, you already are. You were baptised as a baby.  
But merely being baptised, doesn’t quite guarantee your safety.  
To be a true Christian, you must be baptised on the inside.  
You can have assurance of heaven, as soon as you decide  
to confess to God that you’ve been bad, say sorry for your sins,  
say thank-you, Jesus, for the cross, and invite the Spirit to live within  
your heart. If you’re ready, then right now we could pray.  
  
[Child:] Okay, I’m ready Daddy. Could you tell me what to say?  
  
[Father:] Father God, I’m sorry for the wrong things I have done.  
Lord Jesus, thank-you -- for forgiving every single one.  
You died on the cross for me, then you rose again.  
Please fill me with your Spirit. In Jesus’ name, Amen.  
  
[Child:] Father God, I’m sorry for the wrong things that I’ve done.  
Lord Jesus, thank-you -- for forgiving every single one.  
You died on the cross for me, then you rose again.  
Please fill me with your Spirit. In Jesus’ name, Amen.  
  
[Father:] Okay, my son, it’s getting late. You must go back to bed.  
But first, there is a final thing that needs to be said.  
Beloved son, the Bible says, that when you prayed that prayer  
all the angels in God’s house were dancing on their chairs!  
You just did the best thing that can be done by any girl or boy.  
And at this very moment, all of heaven celebrates with joy!  
So now you know for sure that if you die, you’ll go to heaven!  
And if he bothers you anymore, just tell that to the Dragon!  
  
[Child:] Goodnight, Daddy!
