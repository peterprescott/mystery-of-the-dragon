## 6.	Disaster Strikes (‘I’m Sorry But…’)  
  
The scene shifts back to Job, who’s set for work, in suit and tie,  
ready for another diligent day’s nine-to-five,  
investing the talent he’s been given in this life.  
He’s a multibillionaire, but he still tries to get the small things right.  
Poor soul! He’s no suspicion of his impending plight.  
Defencelessly he sits in the satanic sniper’s sights.  
He’s blissfully unaware that he’ll be bankrupt by tonight  
because of a bigger battle being waged in heaven’s heights.  
  
It’s an ordinary day, till suddenly disaster strikes  
Lucifer deploys Hell’s Angels – I’m not talking motorbikes.  
It’s a diabolic blitzkrieg, quicker than the Third Reich’s.  
The worst evil’s efficient, banal and businesslike.  
But let’s give Job the businessman, the final chance to take stock  
of his riches while they’re his—before it strikes nine o’clock.  
His state-of-the-art offices, robotic high-tech factory blocks;  
his aquaponic agriculture, & organic free-range flocks;  
his portfolio (proportioned perfectly) of global shares and stocks--  
but now the clock strikes nine, and an uninvited someone knocks...  
  
“I’m sorry but I came as fast as I possibly could–  
I have some news to tell you, I’m afraid it isn’t good.  
  
Your offices, your factories—they’re blown to pieces, been destroyed.  
They’re saying it’s an inside job, sabotage by those employed  
by you, sir, and what’s worse, somehow that renders void  
the insurance guarantees—I’ll understand if you’re annoyed!”  
  
My own employees! Who’d have thought  
that they would be the ones that brought  
destruction to a lifetime’s work.  
I tried to give good pay and perks!  
But though this wounds my moral sense  
and will cost me some pounds and pence  
I must refuse to take offense  
for God alone is my defence.  
Why should my heart be made distraught,  
when ultimately wealth means naught?  
And whoever the culprits be  
my prayer for them must be simply,  
‘Forgive! They know not what they do.’  
Then suddenly there came Knock Two:  
  
“I’m sorry but I came as fast as I possibly could–  
I have some news to tell you, I’m afraid it isn’t good.  
  
Your farming and your fields…  
your recent record harvest yields…  
your flocks and all your herds…  
forgive me, but in other words  
It seems to have transpired  
that everything caught fire:  
all incinerated,  
completely obliterated.  
Apparently, it’s no-one’s fault—  
somehow a stray thunderbolt  
triggered this strange chain-of-events  
causing this awful consequence.  
They’re say’ng one to a billion odds  
Insurance won’t pay—it’s an ‘act of God’.  
  
The evil of the human heart is a deep, mysterious thing  
But this ‘act of God’—I find much more strange and puzzling.  
When evil men do evil deeds, the right response should be the same:  
Forgive as we’re forgiven. But what if God’s the one to blame?  
No! this absurd atrocity  
must not! trap me in philosophy,  
O Lord! To respond responsibly,  
I need words! of deep doxology:  
Though the fig not blossom, And no fruit be on the vine;  
Though the olive fail, And the wedding be without its wine;  
The flock be cut off from the fold, no herd be in the stalls—  
Yet I will rejoice in God: the Lord’s my joy, my all in all.  
As Job persists,(----) in faith, almost stubbornly  
there comes at the door Knock Number Three.  
  
“I’m sorry but I came as fast as I possibly could–  
I have some news to tell you, I’m afraid it isn’t good.  
  
I bring word from the stock exchange:  
something’s happened—something strange.  
To tell you this is most unpleasant,  
but every single last investment  
that you held across the globe  
has, through unknown cause, implod-  
ed! I don’t know what to do!  
Nor do I know on earth who  
could mastermind such a thing.  
To be quite frank, it’s baffling--  
billions of assets, gone in a flash!  
Yet without trigg’ring financial crash!  
The only companies affected  
were those in which you were invested.  
It’s uncanny, beyond suspicious!  
This cannot just be inauspicious  
chance—rather someone malicious.  
And yet someone so surreptitious  
they’ve engineered your bankruptcy  
in successful secrecy.  
  
This wasn’t what I expected, when I came to work today,  
arriving early, so that I’d have time to meditate and pray.  
I’ve sometimes wondered what I’d do, if the fateful day should come  
if everything for which I’ve worked, all of my hard-earned income,  
should disappear and leave me with nothing in my possession--  
would the loss of outward wealth sink me into depression?  
No! why are you downcast? O my shaken soul!  
Why are you discouraged by circumstance beyond control?  
I will not be dismayed by the loss of mere silver and gold.  
The Lord is my real treasure, on to Him my heart will hold.  
But the trial hasn’t finished yet. It gets worse, there’s more.  
As Job stirs up his shaken soul, there comes knock number four.  
  
“I’m sorry but I came as fast as I possibly could–  
I have some news to tell you, I’m afraid it isn’t good.  
  
I’m sorry sir, but I have some information  
which I’d rather not discuss, but I’m under obligation  
to bring these sorts of things to your consideration…  
Stop blabbing like a fool, just start the explanation.  
I was out last night together with your daughters and your sons  
But there’s been a disaster, and now everyone’s  
dead! They’re dead! They’re all-of-them dead!  
Forgive my f- fu- fumbling—it's on repeat inside my head!  
  
Oh my God, my children! Not my daughters & my sons!  
I prayed it wouldn’t come to this. My dear beloved ones.  
Even tears are failing me. I’m overwhelmed. I’m numb.  
I don’t think I have words for this—can I just speak in tongues?  
I need supernatural help for this situation.  
I need more than just a miracle--I need interpretation!  
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Like four bullets in my chest--  
I’ve been stripped of every blessing with which I’ve been bless’d.  
In an hour—no, an instant!—God has taken all that’s mine  
And reclaimed it, without asking, for His own unknown design.  
I thought that I was something—I had power, I was rich—  
But look at me now, a sorry helpless son-of-a-bitch!  
No! No! No! No! I won’t let go of my dignity--  
If I was once successful, it was due to my integrity.  
God brought me naked out from my mother’s womb  
and thus I will return to Him, when my dead body’s in a tomb.  
The Lord has blessed me—now the Lord takes away.  
Whatever happens still I will bless His holy name.
