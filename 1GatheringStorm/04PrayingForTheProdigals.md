## 4.	Praying for the Prodigals  
  
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name  
It’s a privilege to worship you, a joy just to be praying  
You’re King of kings, You’re Lord of lords, Yes you’re the one who reigns  
But there’s something I must mention, though it makes me feel ashamed.  
You’ve blessed me, God, with blessings that surpass mere human measure  
With a beautiful family and profuse financial treasure,  
So whatever my heart desires I can enjoy at leisure  
There’s nothing that I can’t afford to satisfy my pleasure.  
  
Now with such wealth and power, there has come much temptation  
But my soul has stayed steadfast in resisting dissipation  
The one thing that I long for is complete sanctification  
-- but sadly, this cannot be said, of the next generation.  
O Father, if I’m guilty, then this is my sin  
That as a father I’ve neglected healthy discipline  
And so my sons and daughters have no self-control within  
They’re swept away by lustful waves of adrenaline.  
  
I’m praying for the prodigals//in Your mercy, hear my prayer.  
I’m praying for the prodigals//you’re a Father too—I know you care.  
I’m praying for the prodigals//in Your mercy, hear my prayer.  
I’m praying for the prodigals//you’re a Father too—I know you care.  
  
God! you know I love them, o God this is my prayer --  
For you’re a Father too, and as a father you must share  
this undiluted, resolute love beyond compare –  
so though they deserve judgement, have mercy God and spare  
Them from the consequences of the actions they have done.  
It may not be valid to say they’re just having fun,  
After all, they’re adults now, they’ve all turned twenty-one,  
But please accept the prayer of a father for his son.  
  
I’m crying out on bended knee, I’ve fallen on my face,  
I’m crying out for mercy Lord! I’m crying out for grace  
Whatever wrong they may have done, Lord please would you erase  
it from their record, wipe it clean, delete the database!  
I know they’re far from perfect, I know they’ve made mistakes!  
And some of what they’ve done is simply a disgrace  
But Lord they’re still my children—so whatever it takes,  
If needful, Lord—if possible—just judge me in their place!  
  
I’m praying for the prodigals//in Your mercy, hear my prayer.  
I’m praying for the prodigals//you’re a Father too—I know you care.
