## 7.	Lucifer, are you back?  
  
Hey Lucifer, is that you? Are you back?  
I need a word with you – I think you’ve strayed off track.  
Last time we spoke, you had called into question  
Job’s sincere love, so I gave you his possessions  
but I said nothing that gave you the right to slaughter  
Job’s beloved family—all his sons, and all his daughters.  
  
I remember what you said, God, but there was nothing that forbids  
me from doing what I liked to your friend’s darling kids.  
You said, if I remember, that I could destroy his wealth,  
and the one condition that you gave, was that I not disturb his health.  
Correct me if I’m wrong, God, but you didn’t say a thing  
about your precious puritan’s pampered little offspring.  
In fact, it must be pointed out, I do so with discretion  
In Job’s patriarchal culture, children are indeed possessions.  
So in fact, I’m innocent of even trivial transgression!  
In my view, it’s actually you, who’s guilty—of aggression.  
  
Satan, you wriggling worm – how’d you become such a snake?  
The suffering you’ve incited – why it makes my heart break.  
I still remember when you were foremost among creation  
conducting all the cherubim who sang in celebration  
on the day I made the heavens, and the stars sang for joy.  
You had everything I’d made at your disposal to enjoy.  
You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created  
until somehow you overdosed, became intoxicated  
with the beauty of yourself, you were disorientated,  
and this narcissistic pride meant that you isolated  
yourself more and more, from every true source of love,  
till finally I had no choice, but to cast you out from heav’n above.  
  
Okay, God, please stop – we’ve been through this before.  
And I’m sorry but I must admit, I’m finding this a bore.  
That might be your perspective, but from where I’m situated  
the honest truth is that I feel that I’ve been liberated.  
No longer do I have to give you glory as my King  
a nauseating task that is just really not my thing.  
Now I have the freedom to do exactly as I please--  
is that really such a dark and dangerous disease?  
  
Well, to come back to the subject, it was for Job’s poor kids  
Pleasure’s fine, but consider the consequence of what you did.  
But forget it—it’s true, no matter what I say  
your conscience is dead, so let’s just talk about J.  
  
Oh my goodness, God, are we still talking about Job?  
Okay he still worships you, but you didn’t even let me probe--  
Just give me permission to get under his skin  
and you’ll see just how rotten is the heart that’s hid within.  
  
Alright Satan, it’s a deal—he’s completely in your hand.  
But don’t dare take my friend’s life! Are you sure you understand?
