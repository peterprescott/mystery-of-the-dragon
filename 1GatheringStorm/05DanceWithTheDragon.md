## 5.	Dance with the Dragon  
  
Dance with the Dragon! Dance with the Dragon!  
Let’s fill another flagon with wine as we dance tonight!  
Eat, drink, be merry, for tomorrow we may die  
Have sex, get drunk, get happy, and if it helps get high  
  
We’ve got girls in bikinis // and we’re sipping on martinis  
eating caviar linguine // in my vintage Lamborgini.  
We’re driving my Ferrari // Drinking Coke laced with Bacardi  
Driving drunk is somewhat naughty // But the truth is we ain’t sorry  
Dance with the Dragon! Dance with the Dragon!  
Let’s fill another flagon with wine as we dance tonight!  
Eat, drink, be merry, for tomorrow we may die  
Have sex, get drunk, get happy, and if it helps get high  
Yeah, I’m richer than the Great Gatsby  
My chauffeur drives me in a limousine taxi  
I’m about image, some might call me flashy  
But for some reason, it don’t make me happy…  
  
Dance with the Dragon! Dance with the Dragon!  
Let’s fill another flagon with wine as we dance tonight!  
Eat, drink, be merry, for tomorrow we may die  
But for some reason happiness is proving hard to find.  
  
Mama, she ain’t watching, and Daddy he don’t care.  
And God, well if He loves the world then ask Him, Why is there  
So much suffering and evil – I’ve had more than my fair share!  
Even though I’ve once or twice tried lifting up a prayer.  
Dance with the Dragon! Dance with the Dragon!  
Let’s fill another flagon with wine as we dance tonight!  
Eat, drink, be merry, for tomorrow we may die  
-- but something in me’s troubled as I look toward the sky  
Now the party’s over – it’s my moment of clarity  
It’s the moment I realise that it’s all just vanity  
I think I’m too far gone for my father’s Christianity  
But I need some help from somewhere – cuz I’m losing my humanity.  
  
Dance with the Dragon! Dance with the Dragon!  
Let’s fill another flagon with wine as we dance tonight!  
Eat, drink, be merry, for tomorrow we may die  
-- but there must be something more than this, I’ve been living a lie.
