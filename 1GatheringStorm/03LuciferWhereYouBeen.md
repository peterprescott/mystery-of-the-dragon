## 3.	Lucifer, where you been?  (85 bpm/ 105 bpm)  
  
Hey Lucifer, is that you? Where you been?  
It’s been a little while since you were last seen  
In my throne room up here in the heavenlies  
In fact, I think that if my memory’s  
Correct, the last time we saw you here,  
You were running for your life, trembling with fear  
Falling down through the heavens like a bolt of lightning  
But I suppose to be fair, that I can be frightening  
Especially towards those who go telling lies  
To my beloved human beings—you here to apologize?  
If so just say the word, and I’ll see what I can do  
To atone for your sin, so that once again you  
Can  join the angels and take your place  
To praise me for the glory of my grace!  
  
*With all due respect, don’t gimme that sh*t  
Some of us, we’re getting tired of it  
tired of your self-centred, self-righteous crap  
so let’s have a battle, in freestyle rap.  
But why just a battle? Why not holy war?  
There’s a lot of things you need to answer for!  
I mean, why’s it you that gets all the praise?  
All the «Blessing and honour to the Ancient of Days…»  
What makes you so special anyway?  
And—whatever you do—please do not say  
That you’re different because you’re uncreated  
In my opinion that claim should be debated  
I mean, in the Bible, you need two or three  
Witnesses to accept any testimony  
And your only witness is you, ‘ least that’s how it looks to me  
So c’mon ‘God’, please tell us what you answer’s going to be?*  
  
Haha, Satan – call me Lucifer – you’re tying yourself in knots  
Try as you might you won’t succeed to trap me in a paradox  
You want the other witnesses of my uncreated divinity?  
Well that’s easier than you think—after all, we’re the Trinity!  
Have you forgotten, Satan, that we’re Father, Spirit and Son?  
So that’s three witnessing persons, though in essence we are One.  
But let’s get to the point, which is that when I first made you  
I designed you to delight in that which is most good and true  
So what all of this means is that in spite of your addiction  
To your own pride and greed, in fact there’s no real contradiction  
Between my love for you and my command that you worship me—  
I know because I made you, that’s the only way that you’ll find peace  
[And unspeakable joy, and every other thing that’s good  
That’s why the law of love’s the only rule that’s needed in my ‘hood]()  
You want a concrete example? Consider my friend J  
He loves me with all his heart, and worships me every day  
And if you were to ask him, I think that he would say  
He does this not because he must, but just because he may!  
  
*Uh, seriously God, you’re talking about Job?  
Who swans around the land of Uz wearing a gold-hemmed robe?  
He worships you out of love? Aw, that’s sweet—and real funny  
I would have said he worships you because you give him money.  
I know! Why not experiment! And see what Job will say  
If you give me permission to take his wealth away!  
Cuz I suspect that scientific scrutiny will find  
misfortune might be all it takes to change his oh-so-godly mind.*  
  
Alright Satan – Lucifer – I’ll let you take Job’s wealth,  
So long as you promise me you will not touch his health.  
Okay, you agreed? Then you got yourself a deal.  
But I tell you now that you will find that my friend’s love is real.
