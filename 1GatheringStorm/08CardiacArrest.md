## 8.	Cardiac Arrest  
  
Cut back to Job, who’s still reeling from the news  
he’d received that morning. Put yourself in his shoes:  
He used to have it all, now he has nothing left to lose.  
Imagine, if you can, how perplexed and how confused  
he must be to find that his almighty God should choose  
to permit the devil to torture and abuse  
Job to prove whether his faith is really true.  
& what’s done was just trial number one—it’s time for number two.  
  
Thus the second phase begins of this terrible test  
to force the substance of Job’s soul to be made manifest.  
He has no idea—in fact, he could hardly have guessed  
that the reason why he’s so unnaturally hard-pressed  
is not that he is guilty of somehow having transgressed—  
rather, God’s impressed! But forgive me, I’ve digressed,  
while Job’s become aware of a sharp pain inside his chest  
and topples backwards in a state of cardiac arrest.  
  
(Help! Someone call an ambulance!)
