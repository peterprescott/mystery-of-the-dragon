## 2.	Meet Job  (70 bpm )  
  
Meet Job, a man who worshipped God, a moral paradigm,  
His perfect life’s about to morph into a pantomime.  
It starts like every story does, ‘Once upon a time…’  
If you have ears to hear then hear, and listen to my rhyme.  
Not only was Job righteous, not only was he good,  
--he had at least as much money as an honest person could.  
Which was perhaps the just reward for doing what he should,  
After all would a just God bless Job? Well, sure he would!  
  
As all mere humans know, such blessing cannot be  
assumed to last forever, in sweet serenity.  
No. Wealth and fortune in this life have no such guarantee.  
And with that statement ringing in our ears ominously  
We prepare to meet our hero – but before we begin  
Let’s see if we can first of all try to listen in  
To see what’s taking place in the courts of heaven.  
I think I see the face of that fallen angel, Satan.
