## 1.	Hip Hop Homily   (95 bpm)  
  
A hip hop  homily//is an anomaly.  
God give me words to speak//Find me the truth I seek.  
Subject of suffering--//there is no tougher thing.  
Spirit of prophecy,//reveal the Cross to me.  
  
Testing, testing, one two, mic check  
Now you probably don’t know Micah yet  
I’m sergeant major, he’s my cadet  
But this sergeant’s majorly in Micah’s debt  
Cuz these beats are his, give him due respect  
Yeah he made these beats for my cassette  
So this ain’t my show, this is Micah’s set!  
Okay, here we go! On your mark, get set!  
  
Press pause —I want these words to mark ya  
More permanently than a permanent marker  
I’ve been given great power, I’m Peter Parker  
The power of these words could even start a  
revolution, reformation, call it what you will  
I’m Morpheus , inviting you to swallow the red pill  
This is gospel truth, not just lyrical skill  
My word’s my bond, James Bond , licence to kill

On your marks, set, go! If you’re ready or not!  
Knock, knock – who’s there? – Hey, what’s up, Doc?  
Great Scott, Marty ! It’s Peter Prescott!  
Yeah I’m Peter Prescott, I’m here to praise God!  
I’m Back From The Future where I’m king of hip hop!  
Can you hear the clocks ticking, tock, tick, tick tock.  
There’s a gathering storm  —I’m the first raindrop!  
And the race begins! Here we go, chip chop!  
  
Clip, clop, clip, clop, riding on my horse  
I’m a circuit rider , the world’s my race-course  
Holy Ghost in my sails, He’s my driving force  
are you ready for this? It’s a tour de force!  
Yeah, I’m on my bike, this my Tour de France  
With rhymes so dope, you could call me Lance .  
Poetry, Turntables, Spray-paint, Breakdance  
With some Bible Knowledge , we got all the elem-ance.

Aristotle, are you ready?  For poetic catharsis!  
Though I’m not just a poet, I’m a lyrical artist  
I’m battle rapping against the forces of darkness  
I’m doing whatever I can to impart this  
whole-hearted passion for Christ into your heart, this  
won’t be easy! It might even be the hardest  
thing there is to do, well I’m doing it regardless.  
You might kill me, but I’m Stephen, and look at Saul of Tarsus--  
  
Okay! Here we go! Let’s have some fun!  
We’ll be wrestling with the vexing big question:  
of how can a good God be consistent  
with evil’s undeniable existence!  
Well, find yourself a Bible, we need assistance  
from Scripture. In partic’lar, the classic instance  
of someone suffering despite his innocence.  
Okay, Job chapter one, let’s see what’s written…
