## 9.	Ambulance  
  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
  
Excuse me I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights gonna make you dance  
I’m a necessary extravagance  
though some people call this arrogance  
Lights flashing, sirens wailing  
Danger and delight dovetailing  
It’s so-so, when it’s smooth sailing  
but the siren gives me a rush unfailing  
  
I’m quick to respond in a time of crisis  
even sceptics can’t deny this  
If God’s good, we must apply this  
to a world dying of politeness  
We’ve been made in His image, likeness  
C’mon! now’s not the time for shyness.  
Time’s running out, though I know God’s timeless,  
Act in faith! Don’t be self-righteous.  
  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
  
Give us a call and we’ll come and getcha  
Pick you off the floor, put you on a stretcha  
Pull up your sleeve, take your blood pressure.  
Say Thankyou; we’ll say, My Pleasure.  
Human life is the greatest treasure.  
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  
Count on me whatever the weather  
We are all in this together.  
  
Speed limits don’t even apply to me  
I break them without impropriety  
& my rule-breaking’s entirely  
for the good of our society.  
Everything on the road steers wide of me  
cuz nobody wants to collide with me  
Don’t you dare get on the wrong side of me.  
Siren’s on, so I can’t come quietly  
  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
  
If you ever face an emergency  
Call me and I’ll come with urgency  
in an ambulance, I’m a surgeon, see?  
Resurrection’s having a resurgency.  
It’s my passion, I drive with fervency  
I fly down the road like a Persion C-  
A R P E & T,  
C A R P E & T  
  
& if you can’t spell, that’s a Persian carpet  
Buy yours at the tourist market  
Mine’s handmade from silken scarlet  
Like I were a Hollywood starlet  
Treat myself to my own red carpet  
Yeah, my tastes are so upmarket  
Gotta stay cool, gotta stay light-hearted  
As we dive into deeps uncharted.  
  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance  
Excuse me, ‘scuse me, I’m an Ambulance  
My flashing lights, flashing lights, gonna make you dance
