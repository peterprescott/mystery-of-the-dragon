3.	Nevertheless  
  
Hold on there doctor, no-one’s blaming you  
I know you’re doing all you can do  
to help us as we’re walking through  
the valley of the shadow of death—it’s true:  
Less Psalm 23, more Psalm 22.  
My God, my God, tell me why’ve you  
forsaken me! your presence withdrew  
& my decline in fortune seems undue.  
Nevertheless, though I feel dejected,  
God, you’re faithful, tried and tested,  
Holy, righteous, so majestic.  
My faith in you is real, authentic.  
I’ve made my decision, I don’t regret it  
Whatever You’re doing, I accept it.  
So if I need to be corrected  
I’m clay in your hands, let me be perfected.
