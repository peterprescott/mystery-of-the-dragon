8. The Christian Moralist (‘Thou shalt not’)  
  
Excuse me, friend, please mind your language  
Why’s every sentence a swear-word sandwich?  
I know you need to express your anguish  
But there’s no need to let politeness vanish.  
May I inform you, querulously  
That you are stepping precariously  
close to falling perilously  
into speaking blasphemously.  
  
Doesn't it say somewhere in the Bible  
That even the archangel Michael  
Wasn't so stupid, so suicidal  
As to directly curse his rival  
The Dragon: the original archetypal  
Symbol of evil, pure and primal.  
Just a word of wisdom, as a fellow disciple,  
I am concerned for your survival.  
  
What were you taught? Do I need to remind you?  
Thou shalt not! break the rules that confine you.  
Don’t be bad — or you’ll deserve a punishment.  
I must add — you’re such an embarrassment.  
  
I woke up to pray early this morning  
I always rise before the day begins dawning  
And I heard a voice, whispering a warning  
I must say, that my skin began crawling!  
It came to remind us, ‘No-one can be righteous’  
Humans are all diseased with a virus  
like an impoverished version of Midas  
everything we touch crumbles to fine dust.  
  
Stop and think! Would an omnipotent  
God allow evil to befall the innocent?  
Surely not! To suggest so is impudent!  
Why, it almost makes God appear impotent!  
How dare you! You say I equivocate  
as to whether God might evaluate  
anyone innocent, righteous. At any rate  
you must repent--don’t try to prevaricate!  
  
What were you taught? Do I need to remind you?  
Thou shalt not! break the rules that confine you.  
Don’t be bad—you’ll deserve a punishment.  
I must add—you’re such an embarrassment.
