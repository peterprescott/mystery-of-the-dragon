5.	Curse God & Die  
  
[Wife]  
She said: Wow, babe, I don’t know what to say  
Yesterday, all our troubles seemed far away  
But today, we’ve been hit like judgment day  
Lost it all, and our kids all passed away.  
I mean, it’s great, I appreciate  
the way you bounce off the floor and pray  
these big bold prayers so full of faith  
but I need some time, is that okay?  
  
[Job]  
Beloved, of course, I understand.  
Look in my eyes, let me hold your hand.  
I know it’s the worst day we’ve ever had  
But we gotta trust God, through good and bad.  
  
[Doctor]  
Doctor’s back, please excuse me.  
Just another piece of bad news. We  
‘ve just had some more results arrive. The  
test shows you have H-I-V.  
  
[Wife]  
What do you mean, he’s got HIV?  
What the hell! That’s an STD!  
What’s going on? You been cheating on me?  
Don’t you dare be playing games with me!  
‘But it’s biblical, bit of polygamy!’.  
Okay, let’s take the Bible literally!  
How about we mutilate your masculinity!?  
Isn’t that what it says explicitly?  
  
[Job]  
Beloved, hold on! What you talking about?  
I would never give you the runabout!  
I’ve been faithful to you. Trust me, don’t doubt!  
I don’t know what’s going on but you need to chill out!  
  
[Wife]  
Chill out? What’s that supposed to mean?  
‘Late nights at the office’ Where’ve you really been?  
I’m tired of your lies! Your damn smokescreen!  
And I’m the one that’s the drama queen?  
Oh c’mon Job! Please don’t deny  
whatever you’ve done to draw God’s fire  
Why don’t you just curse God and die?  
Anyway, I’m leaving. This is it. Goodbye.
