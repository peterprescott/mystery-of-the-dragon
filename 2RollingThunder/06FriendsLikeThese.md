6. Friends Like These  
  
So Job lies diseased/ Bankrupt and bereaved.  
Everything lost in the blink of an eye.  
Wife walked out the door/ but three friends, and a fourth,  
in his hour of need, come and stand by his side.  
A true friend will fight/ with you through the night  
battling back-to-back in the eye of the storm.  
But some friends (so-called)/ actually have the gall  
to tell you all the ways that you underperformed.  
  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
  
An Atheist, a Buddhist/ a Christian moralist--  
of all Job’s friends, the wisest three.  
Don’t worry if you find it/ a challenge to follow this--  
try taking notes, call them A, B, and C.  
We’ve condensed their dialogue/ they verbalized a lot!  
What you have here are just summaries:  
a simple attempt / to perhaps represent  
the substance of their different philosophies.  
  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
  
Surely implicit in / coming to visit him  
was the desire to encourage their friend.  
However the fact is/ they could do with some practice—  
Encouragement clearly wasn’t their strength.  
To be fair, to begin with/ they at least didn’t sin with  
their mouths—they kept silent and said not a word.  
But imagine how awkward/for Job to be cornered  
in front of their eyes like a caged flightless bird.  
  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
  
Silent they stood there/and misunderstood their  
role. They should merely have consoled their friend.  
Instead of playing/the devil explaining  
things which mere humans cannot comprehend.  
But first, before they /begin to portray  
this crisis as being somehow Job’s fault.  
He breaks the silence, /explosion of violence!  
a blast from his lips like a thunderbolt.
