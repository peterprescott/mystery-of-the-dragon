9. The Buddhist (‘Life is suffering’)  
  
Birth is suffering, ageing is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
  
Shouldn’t have done what you did Job, shouldja!  
Wouldn’t have thought it’d be like this, wouldja!  
Couldn’t avoid your Karma coming back, couldja!  
You were always a self-centred pious do-gooder.  
Let me give some advice to you from the Buddha.  
He’s sat on my mantelpiece—quite the good-looker.  
The First Noble Truth, if I’ve understood her,  
is Life is suffering: we call that dukkha.  
  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Breakfast is suffering, lunch is suffering,  
tea is suffering, supper is suffering.  
  
Life is suffering: senseless brutality.  
To deny this is sentimentality.  
You must transcend mundane morality  
Become one with the universality  
Escape from the cycle of birth and mortality.  
Dissolve into blissful detached generality.  
This isn’t ‘religion’. Call it ‘spirituality’.  
Wake up from the dream of personality.  
  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Hope is suffering, love is suffering,  
joy is suffering, peace is suffering.  
  
Dark & Light, Wrong & Right – it’s all an illusion  
The question of meaning has no solution  
Caught in the thought of truth? You must go higher  
All dualistic distinctions are maya.  
The truth is Life is meaningless.  
We ignore this out of squeamishness.  
Just dissolve into anaemic bliss.  
(He spluttered, with a fiendish hiss.)
