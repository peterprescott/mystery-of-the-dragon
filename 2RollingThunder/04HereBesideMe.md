4.	Here Beside Me  
  
I’m a light in the darkness, now unplugged from its socket  
I’m an astronaut floating without a space-rocket  
But beloved, my photo’s in your necklace locket.  
So I’ll put on my coonskin, I’m Davy Crockett.  
They say ‘Life’s a dick. When it gets hard, fuck it’.  
But I’m not so easily kicking the bucket.  
What do they take me for? Kermit the Muppet?  
I’ve had my strings cut, but I’m more than a puppet.  
  
I lie on this sick bed, diseased, unsightly,  
But my bride, my beloved—you’re still here beside me.  
You’re my delight, my sweet Aphrodite.  
Give me your hand, let me hold it tightly.  
Girl, you’re my angel—thank God Almighty!  
A glimmer of light to my troubled psyche  
They’re asking, ‘Will we make it through?’ Looks dicey!  
but I prophesy we will! So bite me!  
  
For better, for worse//for richer, for poorer//in sickness and health//till death us do part  
  
We’ve had our good times, our moments of ecstasy  
and one resulted in our very first pregnancy.  
We were believing for a pain-free delivery  
Supernatural Childbirth—did we misread the recipe?  
Fifty-hour labour, while I looked on helplessly,  
Girl you did fantastically, you gave birth naturally.  
Except that when I cut his cord it turned out actually  
you’re hemorrhaging rapidly—rush her up to casualty!  
  
So I waited with the baby, while you lay in surgery  
and that night I slept beside you, curled up on a chair to be  
as close as close could be; the nurse that night was mercifully  
sympathetic. But the next day brought yet more adversity.  
No-one could explain why it was that your nerves could be  
completely dysfunctional. They tested you thoroughly.  
MRI, ultrasound, Computerised Tomography.  
Surely there was something that could have been done medically?  
  
For better, for worse//for richer, for poorer//in sickness and health//till death us do part  
  
I’m not dissing the doctors, I bless the NHS!  
I’m so grateful for free healthcare.—Obviously, YES.  
But three more months on crutches? mastitis in your breast?  
My only explanation is to humbly suggest  
that we were undergoing a huge spiritual test.  
And through it all God taught you to sing Nevertheless.  
‘I—rest—my—case!’ – that we’ll never forget!  
When suffering is at its worst, I know God still can bless.  
  
And childbirth’s the hardest thing, but at least the pain  
is unto new life coming forth–it is not in vain!  
And we need reminding, again and again  
that the rainbow always comes after the flood of rain.  
Take this truth, install it, in the circuits of your brain.  
Tattoo it on your forehead, in letters large and plain.  
Lest I forget too easily, and begin to complain  
Remind me that redemption was bought with a bloodstain.  
  
For better, for worse//for richer, for poorer//in sickness and in health//till death us do part  
  
But ‘very first pregnancy’—maybe I lied.  
Sometimes it’s so easy to forget and deny  
The pain of the past, and just brush aside  
the reality of tragedy, in your own life.  
Our very first baby never saw the daylight.  
Unborn, yet a real little person who died.  
And it still breaks my heart, it still makes me cry.  
I don’t think I dared then, to ask the Lord, ‘Why?’  
  
But if I started asking, I’m not sure I’d be able to  
know when I should stop, because as we all know it’s true  
that disappointment frequently sneaks up on you.  
We have had our fair share, haven’t we? me and you?  
The visa situation, just after I’d married you,  
Torn a thousand miles apart for forty days times two.  
And when Inge died, December 12th, just before two  
in spite of our prayers, even though she never wanted to.  
  
For better, for worse//for richer, for poorer//in sickness and in health//till death us do part  
  
But I’m not being fair. I’m being a numpty.  
God does respond when we come to him humbly.  
Come with your questions, come with your clumsy  
words and find food for all who are hungry.  
Hungry for truth, put however bluntly.  
Hungry for hope, for yourself and your country.  
Hungry for beauty, when you’re feeling ugly.  
Thus says the Lord, let my Bride come t’ me.  
  
I was in tears just trying to write this  
Don’t think I’ll ever be able to recite this.  
My vision’s gone crazy—like a kaleidos—  
--scope. I can’t cope with this feeling inside it’s  
precious and pure. It’s hard to describe, it’s  
something that transcends the pluses and minus  
-es of this moment: as husband and wife there’s  
nothing can separate. ‘S’how God designed us.  
  
A new dawn is coming, we’re standing at the break of day!  
Though I die, I will live! I declare in Jesus’ name!  
A new dawn is coming, we’re standing at the break of day!  
Though I die, I will live! I declare in Jesus’ name!  
A new dawn is coming, we’re standing at the break of day!  
Though I die, I will live! I declare in Jesus’ name!  
A new dawn is coming, we’re standing at the break of day!  
Though I die, I will live! Let me hear you say AMEN!  
  
  
5.	Curse God & Die  
She said: Wow, babe, I don’t know what to say  
Yesterday, all our troubles seemed far away  
But today, we’ve been hit like judgment day  
Lost it all, and our kids all passed away.  
I mean, it’s great, I appreciate  
the way you bounce off the floor and pray  
these big bold prayers so full of faith  
but I need some time, is that okay?  
Beloved, of course, I understand.  
Look in my eyes, let me hold your hand.  
I know it’s the worst day we’ve ever had  
But we gotta trust God, through good and bad.  
Doctor’s back, please excuse me.  
Just another piece of bad news. We  
‘ve just had some more results arrive. The  
test shows you have H-I-V.  
What do you mean, he’s got HIV?  
What the hell! That’s an STD!  
What’s going on? You been cheating on me?  
Don’t you dare be playing games with me!  
‘But it’s biblical, bit of polygamy!’.  
Okay, let’s take the Bible literally!  
How about we mutilate your masculinity!?  
Isn’t that what it says explicitly?  
Beloved, hold on! What you talking about?  
I would never give you the runabout!  
I’ve been faithful to you. Trust me, don’t doubt!  
I don’t know what’s going on but you need to chill out!  
Chill out? What’s that supposed to mean?  
‘Late nights at the office’ Where’ve you really been?  
I’m tired of your lies! Your damn smokescreen!  
And I’m the one that’s the drama queen?  
Oh c’mon Job! Please don’t deny  
whatever you’ve done to draw God’s fire  
Why don’t you just curse God and die?  
Anyway, I’m leaving. This is it. Goodbye.  
[Job’s wife slams the door and leaves, and you hear her driving away.]  
  
  
6.	Friends Like These  
So Job lies diseased/ Bankrupt and bereaved.  
Everything lost in the blink of an eye.  
Wife walked out the door/ but three friends, and a fourth,  
in his hour of need, come and stand by his side.  
A true friend will fight/ with you through the night  
battling back-to-back in the eye of the storm.  
But some friends (so-called)/ actually have the gall  
to tell you all the ways that you underperformed.  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
An Atheist, a Buddhist/ a Christian moralist--  
of all Job’s friends, the wisest three.  
Don’t worry if you find it/ a challenge to follow this--  
try taking notes, call them A, B, and C.  
We’ve condensed their dialogue/ they verbalized a lot!  
What you have here are just summaries:  
a simple attempt / to perhaps represent  
the substance of their different philosophies.  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
Surely implicit in / coming to visit him  
was the desire to encourage their friend.  
However the fact is/ they could do with some practice—  
Encouragement clearly wasn’t their strength.  
To be fair, to begin with/ they at least didn’t sin with  
their mouths—they kept silent and said not a word.  
But imagine how awkward/for Job to be cornered  
in front of their eyes like a caged flightless bird.  
With friends like these, who needs enemies…  
Silent they stood there/and misunderstood their  
role. They should merely have consoled their friend.  
Instead of playing/the devil explaining  
things which mere humans cannot comprehend.  
But first, before they /begin to portray  
this crisis as being somehow Job’s fault.  
He breaks the silence, /explosion of violence!  
a blast from his lips like a thunderbolt.  
7.	Curse the Dragon  
[Fifty Cent In Da Club starts playing]  
Fuck this pain! It’s my mother-fucking birthday…  
Hey, Job! Could you play something else on the jukebox?  
Something more funky? Trying less hard to shock?  
Here’s another fifty cents—put the coin in the slot.  
Alright, here we go! Drop it like it’s hot!  
[Bass line from Stevie Wonder, Superstition]  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
Bring in the experts at cursing, I’m still just learning.  
Practising my fiddle while Babylon’s burning.  
Was praying in the Temple, now I’m overturning  
tables like I’m Abel, finally returning  
to teach Cain a lesson! Am I my brother’s keeper?  
Funk that! Wanna act like I’m the Grim Reaper!  
I’m a funky peacemaker, not a peacekeeper!  
& a pacemaker won’t help your heart if I see ya!  
Here I am, right beside death’s doorway,  
but I’m stuck, can’t get out life’s hallway.  
If I’m on my way to heaven, where’s the foreplay?  
Excuse my metaphor. Least it’s not the Lord’s Day.  
My life’s a tragedy performed each night on Broadway.  
and God’s directing, and for some reason wants  to portray  
me as the main course in a cannibal gourmet  
feast to feast your eyes on, freeze my heart for sorbet.  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
In one day I lost a billion-dollar fortune.  
& my family too. I’d taken all precautions  
This shit ain’t normal – it’s out of all proportion  
My mind is tangled—theological contortions.  
Why oh why did God put me up for auction  
sold me to the devil, so this hell becomes my portion  
Forgive me’f I’m foolish, I’m worn out with exhaustion,  
Wishing I’d never been born, but died in an abortion.  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
Let’s turn the music up, I wanna get the attention  
not just of the neighbours, no, let’s be heard in heaven.  
God, if you can hear me, I am asking you a question:  
Could you please inform me which minor indiscretion  
has resulted in this disproportionate oppression.  
I’m not claiming that I have achieved moral perfection  
but if you don’t mind, here is a simple suggestion:  
Limit punishment to the scope of the transgression.  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
8.	The Christian Moralist (‘Thou shalt not’)  
  
Excuse me, friend, please mind your language  
Why’s every sentence a swear-word sandwich?  
I know you need to express your anguish  
But there’s no need to let politeness vanish.  
May I inform you, querulously  
That you are stepping precariously  
close to falling perilously  
into speaking blasphemously.  
Doesn't it say somewhere in the Bible  
That even the archangel Michael  
Wasn't so stupid, so suicidal  
As to directly curse his rival  
The Dragon: the original archetypal  
Symbol of evil, pure and primal.  
Just a word of wisdom, as a fellow disciple,  
I am concerned for your survival.  
What were you taught? Do I need to remind you?  
Thou shalt not! break the rules that confine you.  
Don’t be bad—you’ll deserve a punishment.  
I must add—you’re such an embarrassment.  
I woke up to pray early this morning  
I always rise before the day begins dawning  
And I heard a voice, whispering a warning  
I must say, that my skin began crawling!  
It came to remind us, ‘No-one can be righteous’  
Humans are all diseased with a virus  
like an impoverished version of Midas  
everything we touch crumbles to fine dust.  
Stop and think! Would an omnipotent  
God allow evil to befall the innocent?  
Surely not! To suggest so is impudent!  
Why, it almost makes God appear impotent!  
How dare you! You say I equivocate  
as to whether God might evaluate  
anyone innocent, righteous. At any rate  
you must repent--don’t try to prevaricate!  
What were you taught? Do I need to remind you?  
Thou shalt not! break the rules that confine you.  
Don’t be bad—you’ll deserve a punishment.  
I must add—you’re such an embarrassment.  
  
9.	The Buddhist (‘Life is suffering’)  
Birth is suffering, ageing is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
  
Shouldn’t have done what you did Job, shouldja!  
Wouldn’t have thought it’d be like this, wouldja!  
Couldn’t avoid your Karma coming back, couldja!  
You were always a self-centred pious do-gooder.  
Let me give some advice to you from the Buddha.  
He’s sat on my mantelpiece—quite the good-looker.  
The First Noble Truth, if I’ve understood her,  
is Life is suffering: we call that dukkha.  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Breakfast is suffering, lunch is suffering,  
tea is suffering, supper is suffering.  
Life is suffering: senseless brutality.  
To deny this is sentimentality.  
You must transcend mundane morality  
Become one with the universality  
Escape from the cycle of birth and mortality.  
Dissolve into blissful detached generality.  
This isn’t ‘religion’. Call it ‘spirituality’.  
Wake up from the dream of personality.  
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering,  
illness is suffering, death is suffering.  
Hope is suffering, love is suffering,  
joy is suffering, peace is suffering.  
Dark & Light, Wrong & Right – it’s all an illusion  
The question of meaning has no solution  
Caught in the thought of truth? You must go higher  
All dualistic distinctions are maya.  
The truth is Life is meaningless.  
We ignore this out of squeamishness.  
Dissolve into anaemic bliss.  
He spluttered, with a fiendish hiss.
