7. Curse the Dragon  
  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up — childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
  
Bring in the experts at cursing, I’m still just learning.  
Practising my fiddle while Babylon’s burning.  
Was praying in the Temple, now I’m overturning  
tables like I’m Abel, finally returning  
to teach Cain a lesson! Am I my brother’s keeper?  
Funk that! Wanna act like I’m the Grim Reaper!  
I’m a funky peacemaker, not a peacekeeper!  
& a pacemaker won’t help your heart if I see ya!  
  
In one day I lost a billion-dollar fortune.  
& my family too. I’d taken all precautions  
This isn’t normal – it’s out of all proportion  
My mind is tangled — theological contortions.  
Why the hell, why did God put me up for auction  
sold me to the devil, so this cup becomes my portion  
Forgive me if I’m foolish, I’m worn out with exhaustion,  
Wishing I’d never been born, but died in an abortion.  
  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
  
Here I am, right beside death’s doorway,  
but I’m stuck, can’t get out life’s hallway.  
If I’m on my way to heaven, where’s the foreplay?  
Excuse my metaphor. Least it’s not the Lord’s Day.  
My life’s a tragedy performed each night on Broadway.  
and God’s directing, and for some reason wants  to portray  
me as the main course in a cannibal gourmet  
feast to feast your eyes on, freeze my heart for sorbet.  
  
Let’s turn the music up, I wanna get the attention  
not just of the neighbours, no, let’s be heard in heaven.  
God, if you can hear me, I am asking you a question:  
Could you please inform me which minor indiscretion  
has resulted in this disproportionate oppression.  
I’m not claiming that I have achieved moral perfection  
but if you don’t mind, here is a simple suggestion:  
Limit punishment to the scope of the transgression.  
  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!  
  
I'm miserable, I'm angry, I'm overwhelmed with rage.  
I'm a toddler in a tantrum, don't tell me to act my age!  
Today's my birthday -- but no-one's made me any cake.  
Looks like the day I was born that God made a mistake!  
I'm tired of all these Christian songs, they feel so f---ing fake.  
A plastic smile, a new guitar, B minor G D A.  
'Let's sing together to the Lord: "You give and take away..." '  
But I can't do this anymore, all I can do is say:  
  
Forgive me if you feel that I've overstepped a line.  
You asked how I was doing, and I smiled, said I was fine,  
But the truth is I'm so mad, that I'm out my f---ing mind,  
My demons they are Legion, could you spare a herd of swine?  
I cast my pearls before the world -- they crushed them in the grime  
of what was once a pasture green, but now is puddles, shit and slime.  
I thought I'd scored the winning goal, it bounced across the line,  
But the linesman had his flag up, and we lost, in extra time.  
  
Funk this pain! Bless my mother—it’s my birthday.  
Mamas put your hands up—childbirth hurts, hey!  
Raise your glasses! This must be the worst day  
of my life. So curse the Dragon if you’re thirsty!
