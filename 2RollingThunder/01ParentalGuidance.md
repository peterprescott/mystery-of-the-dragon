1.	Parental Guidance  
  
Parental Guidance: this gets gritty  
I’ll try to stay witty but pain’s not pretty.  
  
I’m a supernaturally gifted individual  
Steal the show spectacularly—it’s criminal.  
Transform your mind with my rhymes, subliminal  
rabbinical midrash in tightly-rhymed syllables.  
I’m not egotistical, I stay invisible.  
I’m a mere human in a mask—‘hypocritical’.  
And that’s a pagan dramatical reference, but it’s typical  
to be misunderstood by the body political.  
Does this offend you?—that I’m an angry young man,  
cuz I do this shit (whoops!) for the whole human clan.  
yeah I dare to write rhymes that no Christian can  
without drawing friends’ unfriendly opposition.  
But church you need to know—I’m not your enemy.  
If you get offended, then blame this nervous energy  
on enthusiastic youthful immaturity.  
Please, whatever you do, don’t put me in purgatory.

This one’s for the hypocrites—and!--for the hedonists,  
this one’s for the lawbreakers—and!--for the legalists,  
this one’s for the day-dreamers—and!--for the realists  
for the rap God loyalists, for Dante —and!-- Beatrice.  
Been praying for Eminem since I was twelve years old  
ever since I heard Slim Shady on the radio.  
Praying that God would have mercy upon his soul  
& upon me too—cuz I thought his lyrics were gold!  
There’s something about gold and precious stones  
To find them needs a miner to go down deep alone  
into places where natural life doesn’t dare grow.  
We need revival in the mines—bring the prodigals home!  
You know the story of the donkeys stopping working:  
the Welsh revival meant the miners stopped their cursing.  
Let’s make sure this time, we don’t make it the first thing  
on th’list of sins to quit, cursing’s not the worst thing (--there’s twerking!).

I guess God heard me, see the cross round Marshall’s neck.  
But who am I to judge? No, scratch that, what the heck.  
Let me go ahead and put my cards on the table.  
I believe Marshall Mathers deserves the Christian label  
as much as Matt Redman, as much as Lecrae  
Isn’t the truth that we’re all saved by grace?  
Being a Christian’s a binary state.  
A simple revelation that transforms your fate.  
That doesn’t mean that I’m willing to minimise  
discipleship. I’ve given that ‘ship my life!  
But I believe when you look in Marshall’s eyes,  
you see a kid that don’t know how to compromise.  
Don’t misunderstand—I’m not saying he’s sanctified!  
Least not completely, but then, neither am I.  
But I’m sick to the stomach, I’m so dissatisfied  
with prejudice in the church. So this is my battle cry!

Please don’t get offended. Don’t get self-righteous  
Most religion’s contaminated with the virus  
of moralism, which th’Apostle Paul says is SHITE, a s-  
-ound-bite I found is sometimes made somewhat lifeless  
by most translators who prefer a word that’s more pious.  
Philippians Three Eight, if my reference is right, a s-  
‘skubala’ is more explicit that mere ‘detritus’  
Go find a concodordance, then come back, kiss my white arse.  
Uh-oh, I’m dropping A-bombs on the gates of hell  
Hello, it’s me. You can call me Adele.  
I’m all about that bass, my wife’s been feeding me well.  
I’m not dissing large ladies, let that lie be dispelled.  
They say you’re fat—I say, you’re a fat-bottomed bombshell.  
If you don’t believe me, take pen and paper and spell  
the word ‘fat’, B E A--U T I-- F U L.  
Take that devil! These beauties gonna shout F U Hell!

I’m serious! We’ve watered down the Good News  
Church should be dynamite. But we’re not lighting the fuse,  
so now we amuse ourselves with the refuse  
of a culture that’s suffused with satanic worldviews,  
and go to church on Sunday to sleep through the schmooze  
of.a dude who’s accrued too much fear o’ man to be rude.  
And then we’re bemused, as we sit in our pews,  
that we’re not reaching the nations, let alone the Jews!  
Curses are vital! We just need to curse with discretion.  
Don’t trust me, read Deuteronomy Twenty-Seven.  
Which commands that twelve curses in rapid succession  
be shouted at the church to help keep us from transgression.  
And Christ became a curse for us, that’s how we go to heaven.  
We gotta break this curs-ed covenant with non-aggession.  
Cuz by the signs of the times, we’re obviously headin’  
to another Great Depression and perhaps Armageddon.

Explicit Lyrics: Explicitly Christian  
rapped by the wrath of an angry youth with a mission.  
Curses are spells: I use them like a magician--  
but I shan’t enchant your mind without your kind permission.  
Firing on all pistons, the key’ in the ignition.  
I’ve made the decision to break with tradition.  
This isn’t about manners, it’s about abolition  
of the strongholds that enslave us—they need demolition.  
Parental Guidance: we need the guidance of a Father.  
Mother Mary just won’t do, though I know you’d rather  
Imagine you can Let It Be, though you don’t have answers  
to questions of the Here and Now, let alone Hereafter.  
Instead you drown your sorrows in a third pint of lager,  
you’ve Occupied Wall Street, the One Percent still prosper,  
you watch the evening news show the innocent slaughtered  
And lager cannot do the trick, your wine’s turning to water.
