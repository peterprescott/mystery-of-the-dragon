2.	Modern Medicine  
  
And so Job’s wretched chronicle  
brings us to his local hospital.  
Where a man with a giant monocle  
and a manner most methodical  
makes use of every possible  
test and technological  
means of anatomical  
inspection. How responsible!  
  
Doctor, I've got this feelin'  
Deep inside of me, deep inside of me  
I just can't control my feet  
When I hear the beat, when I hear the beat  
  
Ah hem, ladies & gentlemen,  
what you see here is all genuine.  
The marvel of modern medicine.  
Capable of almost anythin’  
through science and experiment,  
brainchild of Thomas Edison.  
Heal your heart, repair your skeleton,  
just like the Good Samaritan!  
Now I’m sure that you’ll be glad to know  
the results of the tests are back, and show  
that your heart is healthy, yes I know,  
what about events just hours ago?  
That’s why we made you undergo  
so many scans, for thus we hoped  
to systematically overthrow  
all false assessments of the status quo.  
  
Hey doctor, could you give me  
Somethin' to ease the pain ?  
'Cause if you don't help me soon  
Gonna lose my brain, gonna go insane  
  
So your heart’s healthy, but I’m afraid that’s all--  
the rest is the worst that I recall.  
Your organs’re thoroughly dysfunctional,  
and you’ve malignant tumours like billiard balls.  
In fact I’d say that overall  
your in need of a physical overhaul.  
If I were you, my next port of call,  
would be to scream at God, at the Wailing Wall.  
I can’t save your soul, I can’t cure your cancer  
I’m a doctor, not a necromancer  
Do I look like I have a pet salamander?  
I can give you drugs, but I can’t give you answers  
I think it’s God who deserves your anger  
though if He’s there, he’s a no-good gangster  
or at least some sort of perverted prankster.  
Life’s a wheel in a cage, and we’re all just hamsters.  
  
Say, say, say, doctor I got this fever  
That I can't control that I can't control  
Music makes me move my body  
Makes me move my soul, makes me move my soul
